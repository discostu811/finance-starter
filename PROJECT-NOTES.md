# ðŸ““ Project Notes â€” Finance ETL MVP

## ðŸ”¹ Pinned Headers
_Paste output of `npm run inspect:2024` here for Amex, MC, Amazon, Detail._

## ðŸ”¹ Ground Truth Expectations
- Detail tab is the authority; reconciliation must match exactly once features are in place.

## ðŸ”¹ Known Issues / Format Quirks
- Amex can use Debit/Credit instead of Amount; mid-year format changes possible.
- Amazon children must not double-count with parent card rows.

## ðŸ”¹ TODO / Next Steps
- [ ] v0.1 â€” baseline ingestion & 2024 reconciliation
- [ ] v0.2 â€” Amazon linkage
- [ ] v0.3 â€” multi-year + freeze
- [ ] v0.4 â€” categorization
- [ ] v0.5 â€” web app polish

## ðŸ”¹ Debugging Checklist
1. Run `npm run inspect:2024` and paste headers here.
2. Confirm parser matched Amount or Debit/Credit.
3. Confirm Detail extractor found Year/Month/Income/Expenses columns.
4. Compare Î£(children) vs parent for Amazon months (from v0.2).

- Every drop you receive back will include:  
  - `MANIFEST.json` (hashes)  
  - `CHANGES.md` (what changed + how to upgrade)  
  - `PATCHLIST.txt` (list of changed files)  
- Commit convention: `feat(vX.Yb): <summary>`, plus `fix|docs|chore` as needed.
