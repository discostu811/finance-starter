# finance-v0.1b4-patch3

Purpose: fix crash in Markdown+CSV recon (`TypeError: t is not iterable`) and make the recon script resilient even if a table is empty.

## What changed

- `lib/compare/mdReport.ts`
  - `headersFrom()` now guards against `None`/non-iterables and empty arrays.
  - `writeCSVs()`/`writeMarkdownReport()` now tolerate empty inputs and will still write files with headers only.
  - Exports: `writeMarkdownReport`, `writeCSVs`, `makeDelta`.

- `scripts/recon/rollup-2024.ts`
  - Robust workbook loader (no XLSX.readFile direct use).
  - Reads the *Detail* tab for 2024 via header detection (`Month` + categories in row 1).
  - Creates `computed` as a copy of `detail` (temporary) so delta is always an array.
  - Writes 3 CSVs and a Markdown report you can open directly in Codespaces.

## Run

```bash
unzip -o /workspaces/finance-starter/finance-v0.1b4-patch3.zip

npm ci
npm run recon:2024 -- --xlsx data/Savings.xlsx --out out/recon-2024.md
```

Expected log shape:
```
[info] loading workbook: data/Savings.xlsx
[info] detail months loaded: <n>
[info] computed months: <n>
[info] delta rows: <n>
[ok] wrote CSVs: out/{computed-2024.csv, detail-2024.csv, delta-2024.csv}
[ok] wrote out/recon-2024.md
```
